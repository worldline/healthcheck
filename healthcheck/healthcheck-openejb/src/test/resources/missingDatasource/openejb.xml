  #  The passivator is responsible for writing beans to disk
  #  at passivation time. Different passivators can be used
  #  by setting this property to the fully qualified class name
  #  of the PassivationStrategy implementation. The passivator
  #  is not responsible for invoking any callbacks or other
  #  processing, its only responsibly is to write the bean state
  #  to disk.

  #  StrictPooling tells the container what to do when the pool

  #  With strict pooling, requests will have to wait for instances
  #  to become available.  The pool size will never grow beyond the
  #  the set PoolSize value.
  #
  #  Without strict pooling, the container will create temporary
  #  instances to meet demand.  The instances will last for just one
  #  method invocation and then are removed.
